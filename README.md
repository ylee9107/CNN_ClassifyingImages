# Classifying Images with CNN:

This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that will be able to classify images that consists of clothing articles. These images are primarily taken from the Zalando Research Dataset. Generally, this project will go through creating an image-classification model, cross-validating it and then explore methods to improve on the model. 

## Breakdown of this Project:
- Image-Feature Extration
- CNN:
    - Network Topology
    - Convolutional Layers and Filters
    - Max Pooling Layers
    - Flattening
    - Fully-connected Layers and output
- Building the CNN model with KERAS:
    - Train using the Zalando research dataset
    - Classify the images
